
To integrate the pipeline with the OpenShift web console, you create a build configuration that points to this pipeline. 
This build configuration must be in the same project as the Jenkins pod (unless you configure the master-config.yaml to point to another Jenkins instance).


1 - Edit the tasks-pipeline.yaml, if necessary (specialy line 11).

    You are pointing to the Jenkinsfile in the Gogs repository (line 11), as you did in the Jenkins "Tasks" job. 
    It is also possible to embed the entire pipeline script into the build configuration.

2 - Create the build configuration in OpenShift.
oc project jenkins
oc create -f tasks-pipeline.yaml

3 - In the OpenShift web console, switch to your Jenkins project and open the Pipelines view (under Builds).

4 - Click "Start Pipeline" to trigger a new pipeline.

5 - Click "View Log" to view the pipeline progression and follow along in Jenkins.


The Jenkins pipeline performs the following steps:

- Checkout source code
- Build WAR
- Run unit tests
- Perform code analysis
- Publish to Nexus
- Build OpenShift image using binary build
- Deploy to test
- Run integration tests
- Deploy the new version to production (Blue/Green)
- Get approval to switch to the new version
- Switch to the new route

1 - In Jenkins, create a job with the name "Tasks" and type "Pipeline".

2 - Use the Groovy pipeline script (/pipeline/groovy-script.txt), either inline in the Jenkins job, or by storing it in the openshift-tasks Gogs repository and pointing the Jenkins job to it. 
    Depending on the approach make sure to use the correct version of the "Checkout Source" stage. 
    Make sure you double-check references to SkyDNS services and replace <gogs_user> and <gogs_password> with your Gogs user ID and password where necessary.


To automate the build whenever new content is pushed to the "openshift-tasks" repository, set up a Git hook in Gogs. 
This way a Jenkins build is triggered whenever code is pushed to the "openshift-tasks" source repository on Gogs.

1 - Open a browser and log in to Jenkins.

2 - In the top right corner, click the down arrow next to your user name and select "Configure".

3 - Click "Show API Token" and make note of the API token that is displayed.

4 - Open a browser, navigate to the Gogs server, log in, and go to the CICDLabs/openshift-tasks repository.

5 - Click "Settings", and then click "Git Hooks".

6 - Click the pencil next to post-receive.

7 - Under the Hook Content, paste this script, replacing 
    <userid> with your Jenkins user ID, 
    <apiToken> with the API token you retrieved earlier, 
    <jenkinsService> with the name of your Jenkins Service and 
    <jenkinsProject> with the name of the OpenShift project your Jenkins Service is located in.

This script signals the Jenkins "Tasks" build job each time a commit is made to the "master" branch

#!/bin/bash

while read oldrev newrev refname
do
    branch=$(git rev-parse --symbolic --abbrev-ref $refname)
    if [[ "$branch" == "master" ]]; then
    	curl -k -X POST --user <userid>:<apiToken> http://<jenkinsService>.<jenkinsProject>.svc.cluster.local/job/Tasks/build
    fi
done

8 - Click "Update Hook".

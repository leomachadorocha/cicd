
Committing a new version of the application source code triggers a new build as a result of the Git hook you configured. 
It is good practice to increment the version number each time you make changes to your application. 
You can increment the version number manually or automatically.

Increment the version number:

1 - Make some changes in the application, changing something in the title (near line 45).
vi $HOME/openshift-tasks/src/main/webapp/index.js

2 - Increment the version number of the project each time code is pushed using Maven, 
    for example, updating the version number (VERSION=1.7) with the next minor or major number (VERSION=1.8).

cd $HOME/openshift-tasks
export VERSION=1.8
mvn versions:set -f pom.xml -s nexus_settings.xml -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DnewVersion=${VERSION}
git commit -m "Increased version to ${VERSION}" pom.xml
git push gogs master

3 - After a few minutes, when prompted, approve the switch to the new version.

4 - Click "Proceed".

5 - Once the pipeline finishes successfully, verify that you can see the updated application.
